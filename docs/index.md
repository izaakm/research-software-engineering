> A **Research software engineer (RSE)** is someone who uses expertise in

> significant amount of time programming, full-time software engineers writing
> code to solve research problems, and those somewhere in-between.

> **Research software engineering (RSE)** is not *just* software that was made
> for (and mainly used in) research projects. The field focuses on the type of
> software development needed in research, i.e., writing software and
> computational workflows that focus on reproducibility, reusability, and
> accuracy of data analysis that is necessary in research. The term was
> proposed in a [research paper][3] in 2010 in response to an empirical survey
> on tools used for software development in research projects. ([Wikipedia][1])
